// THIS IS THE QUOTA MET SCENE
That all the souls for the night? #gravedigger #portrait: eyes closed smile
You nod, glancing around. You can still feel the presence of many other souls, but they are not ones you have the time to attend to.
We'll be seeing you again soon. #grim #portrait: neutral
You have to return to Hell, your home, and hope you got everything right.
Your approach the stairway to descend, and it feels as it always does.
An unceremonious return home.
You must've have met your quota.
Just another day of work, then. Well done. 
    -> END
