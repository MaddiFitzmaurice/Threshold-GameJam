As if summoned by your very thoughts, a figure begins to emerge from the fog.
You brace yourself for the tirade of anger or pleading, but the presence in front of you seems very, very alive.

Ah. Was wondering when you was gonna show up.

#c:gravedigger
#p:eyes closed smile
Been a few nights, hasn’t it?

#a:desc
You shrug. You've been busy.

#c:gravedigger
#p:smile
Don’t think I’m complaining.

#c:gravedigger 
#p:eyes closed
We had our work to do. 

#c:gravedigger
#p:eyes closed
You stopped countin’ ‘em, yet?

#a:desc
You shake your head. It’s not exactly an option you have.

#c:gravedigger
#p:eyes closed smile
Fair enough. 

#c:gravedigger
#p:smile
Does get easier when y’do, though. 

#c:gravedigger
#p:pout
There’ll be a few waitin’ for you tonight. 

#c:gravedigger
#p:eyes closed
How many exactly, I'm not sure… 

#a:desc
They pause to think, hand brushing over their chin.
In the silence, you hear the jingling of metal, alongside thundering footsteps.
They’re getting rapidly closer.
A large black dog leaps out of the fog. The lantern it carries swings wildly until it is set by its side.

Apologies for my lateness. I wasn’t sure you were going to be here tonight. 

#c:gravedigger
#p:smile
I told y’they would be. 

#c:grim
#p:displeased
You always assume they'll be here. 

#c:gravedigger
#p:pout
Eh. There’s a lot of souls waitin’ for ‘em at the moment. 

#c:grim
#p:neutral
Is that any different to usual? 

#c:gravedigger
#p:look away stressed
You’ve seen how busy I’ve been. 

#c:grim
#p:neutral
I suppose I have. 

#c:grim
#p:neutral
How many can you take tonight? 

#a:desc
You hold up a hand - five fingers.

#c:gravedigger
#p:freakin
That ain’t many. 

#c:grim
#p:squint
It is some, at least. 

#c:grim
#p:squint
Do you know how many you have to take? 

#a:desc
You don't say anything. 
The dog seems to roll her eyes.

#c:grim
#p:displeased
You never do. 

#c:gravedigger
#p:smile
Night won't last forever. Better get started. 

#a:desc
You sigh, and turn your attention away from the minders of the graveyard.
Who calls to you tonight? 
You can only speak to each of them for a few moments - you've found three questions suits you best.
