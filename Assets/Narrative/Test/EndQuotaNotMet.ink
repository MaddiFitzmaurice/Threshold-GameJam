// THIS IS THE QUOTA NOT MET SCENE

That all the souls for the night?

You nod, glancing around. You can still feel the presence of many other souls, but they are not ones you have the time to attend to.

#c:grim

We'll be seeing you again soon. 

#a:exit grim
#a:exit gravedigger
#a:desc
You have to return to Hell, your home, and hope you got everything right.
Your approach the stairway to descend, and wonder if it feels hotter than usual.
It... It definitely does.
The powers that be will be unhappy with you.
Ah, the game of it all.
At least you sent the people to the right places?
